# The news neon 
This is my first website that I build using react js. It is a simple api based wbsite that help users to get updates of the surrounding happenings.

This is my first project that I build after learning react.js

This project covers all the essential react concepts like ---------
    Components
        function based components
        <!-- We can also use class based components but this website is uses function based components -->

    components rendering

    props
    props destructuring
    
    Hooks
        useState
        useEffect

    fetch api in react.js

    etc...
